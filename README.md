:wave: Hey there! I'm a programming hobbyist who likes Python, Lua, and Nix and wants to learn Rust.

## What do you do in open-source?

- I maintain the [`awesome-computercraft`](https://github.com/tomodachi94/awesome-computercraft) list.
- I help moderate the [unofficial NixOS Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RbvHtGa) and a handful of others.
- I maintain some packages [on Nixpkgs](https://repology.org/maintainer/tomodachi94+nixpkgs%40protonmail.com).
- Additionally, I maintain many other inconsequential things on GitHub, like [unicornpkg](https://unicornpkg.madefor.cc).

## What do you do around the Internet?

- I'm an administrator [on the FTB Wiki](https://ftb.fandom.com), a general-purpose Modded Minecraft wiki that has existed since 2012.
- I do a *lot* of editing [on Wikidata](https://wikidata.org/wiki/User:Tomodachi94), which interacts with some of the other interests on this page. I also edit, to a lesser degree, on the [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tomodachi94).

## What do you do IRL?

- :wink: No.

## Can I chat with you?

See the links provided below my profile picture if you'd like to chat with me. I'm always open for people who want to ask me questions!

One request, though: If it's a bug or feature request in something I've built, file a GitHub issue in the respective project, as that's where it will end up when I read your report.

## Can I sponsor you for X/Y/Z?

Not at the moment; I do this for fun, but I appreciate you for asking, level-two header! I recommend donating to [the Internet Archive](https://archive.org) and [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org) if you want to give others money.
