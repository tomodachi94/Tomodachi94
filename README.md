- That one guy who made a PR onto your project for no apparent reason
- That guy who joined one of your chatrooms
- That person who edited some pages on Wikipedia (or your small wiki)
- The one user who made a bunch of programming-related entities on Wikidata
- The person who maintains the `awesome-computercraft` list.
